# LLaMA-2 Response Generation with Post-Quantization Training (PQT) Optimization

This project implements LLaMA-2 for efficient response generation using Post-Quantization Training (PQT) techniques to optimize Performance, Quality, and Time. The LLaMA-2 model, specifically the 7B chat variant, is loaded with 4-bit quantization to reduce memory consumption while maintaining high-quality outputs.

Key aspects of the project include:

Post-Quantization Training (PQT): The model is optimized after training by using 4-bit quantization to significantly reduce its size without compromising performance.
Performance: The use of quantization, multi-threading, and memory management techniques ensures efficient execution on GPU resources.
Quality: Special tokens and unnecessary parts of the model output are removed to provide clean and relevant text.
Time: By leveraging parallel processing, the system can handle multiple prompts efficiently, minimizing response times.
This project demonstrates the use of advanced quantization techniques for large language models, making it suitable for applications requiring scalable, resource-efficient natural language processing solutions.
